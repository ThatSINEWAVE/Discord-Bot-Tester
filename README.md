# Discord Bot Tester

The **Discord Bot Tester** is a convenient utility designed to facilitate the quick testing and updating of profile images, banners, names, and descriptions for multiple Discord bots. It simplifies the process by allowing you to run all your bots at once, ensuring that the desired updates are applied. This is particularly useful because certain bot attributes, such as profile images and descriptions, do not get updated unless the bot runs at least once.
